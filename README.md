### Abstract
The purpose of this study is to develop medical equipment that can help the health-care workers in transferring the patient 
from a hospital bed to other medical equipments such as a wheelchair and a stretcher effectively and without the very-high-risk of 
injury involved with it. This semi-automatic integrated medical equipment can be used as a (1) Hospital Bed (2) Stretcher (3)
Wheelchair. The main objective of the study is to reduce the Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) that has a very-high-risk Rapid Entire 
Body Assessment (REBA) score of (12) among healt-hcare workers who performs the said process. The proponents used the Rapid 
Entire Body Assessment (REBA) to evaluate the whole-body postural MSD and risk associated with the job task. Under REBA ergonomic 
assessment, the REBA score was reduced from a very-high-risk score of (12) to a medium-risk-score of (7) when the proposed 
equipment was used. The system was tested to prove that the device is functioning effectively and safely for the target users. The 
Accuracy, Funtionality, and User-Friendliness Test has been conducted. The device was proven accurate, fuly functional and is user-friendly based on the test results undertaken.

### Methodology
In this research, the proponents first determine thelevel of risk and the amount pain a typical health-care worker experience during the said 
process of transferring a patient. The proponents had used the Rapid Entire Body Assessment tool (REBA) in determining the level of risk,Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for determining the amount of pain of all the healthcare workers available in the hospital. Survey questionaires 
and interviews are used to gather and record these data.

REBA is an ergonomic assessment tool that uses systematic process 
to evaluate whole body postural MSD and risk associated with job task. 
The researchers used a single page worksheet to evaluate required or 
selected body posture, forceful exertions due to load, type of movement or actions, repetitions, and coupling with regard in the process of 
lifting and transferring patient from bed to stretcher or wheelchair. The 
researcher used a separated worksheet for the data in transferring patients from bed to stretcher and another datafor transferring patient
from bed to wheelchair. Using the REBA worksheet, the researchers 
assigned a score for each of the following body regions: wrist, forearm, 
elbows, shoulders, neck, trunk, legs and knees. After the data for each 
region is collected and scored, tables on the form are then used to compile the risk factor variables, generating a single score that represents the level of MSD risk.

For design and technicalities, the proponents used an Arduino 
Mega Microcontroller to control the Stretchair’s function such as inclination and declination of backrest’s slope, emergency stop, magnetic
locking mechanism, RFID access and registration of RFID cards. The proponents had used a linear actuator to incline or decline the backrest’s 
slope, it can push a maximum load of 1800 N. A fail-safe magnetic lock 
is used to keep the Stretchair attached to the hospital bed, a 12V 26Ah 
battery is used to power the Stretchair and the Arduino Mega controls 
buttons that are connected to these functions.
After the design was completed, the proponents conducted a pretest and post-test on health-care workers that experienced the said 
transferring process of patients. The proponents had used the REBA 
assessment tool and the Visual Analogue Scale tool to compare the level 
of risk and the amount of paint in using the Stretchair versus the traditional way of transferring the patient.

### Results and Discussion

The proponents had used the REBA worksheet and got a REBA 
score of (12), which means a very-high-risk score, and need to implement change (See Figure 1 and Table 1). Based on the result, the female 
nurses and nursing profession had the highest frequency that are involve on the process of transferring patients and are experiencing pain 
during transferring. Aside from profession and gender, ages of the 
healthcare workers were also considered, majority of age of healthcare 
on this activity ranges from 26 to 29 and 30 to 35. According to article 
entitled “Work related musculoskeletal disorders among hospital nurses 
in rural Maharashtra, India: A multi centre survey” , ages 25 to 35 of 
healthcare workers who are involved on transferring patients are more 
likely to carry, lift and transfer patients for they are the one who have
enough strength and more capability on doing it compare to those personnel aged 35 and above.
The second part of the results shows the work experiences of forty 
– two (42) healthcare workers during Transferring and carrying of patients from Hospital bed going to Stretcher and to Wheelchair. It was 
proved that there is pain present for both processes. It was also determined that this process contributes a big factor on having body pains 
from lifting and transferring of patient from bed to stretcher or wheelchair, since the survey results tells that 100% of those healthcare workers who are involved in the said process experiencing pain on different 
parts of their body. See Table 2 and Figure 4.
To determine the effectiveness of the proposed prototype, the researchers conducted a Post and Pre – Test of the proposed Hospital bed 
equipment through survey questionnaire among twenty – five (25)
Health care workers respondents of M.V Santiago Diagnostic and Medical Center. Some of the pre – test and post - test result was compared 
through statistical tool and analysis, and the interpretations will determine the effectiveness. By using the Stretchair’s function the device 
significantly reduced the very-high-risk score of (12) to a medium-riskscore of (7) (See Fig.3), the Stretchair had eliminated the lifting process 
that typically injured most of our health-care workers. In terms of body
pain, the device reduced the body pain specially in the lower back by 
96%.

For technical testing the proponents conducted a functionatlity test, safety test and user-friendliness test. Based on the results the 
Stretchair is 94% functional, 100% safe and 93.33% user-friendly

### Conclusion

In conclusion, using the new ergonomically design hospital 
bed, Testing method showed good results as the Risk of Musculoskeletal disorder was reduced from a score of 12 which means very 
high risk to a score of 7 which means medium risk, this comparison 
only tells that the proposed project is effective on reducing pain 
and risk of MSD among healthcare worker who are transferring patients. 
The system can function normally depending on the user’s desire and it is easy to use and learn, the results also shows that the 
system can do all its basic functions that the proponents expected 
that’s why the functionality test has resulted to 94% functionality 
performance
